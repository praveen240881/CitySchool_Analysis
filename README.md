# CitySchool_Analysis
Overview of the school district analysis:
	The purpose of this project is to analyze the data of an entire school district, such as Funding and student grades, to learn new perceptions and understanding the clear results on each school’s performance.
Results:

In school summary data the values of data have retrieved and calculated like average math score, average reading score. When assessing school summaries and performing schools, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
   Overall, it does not affect either the reading scores or math scores. We are doing an investigation because we believe they are not including most of the 9th graders scores because they might bring the school even further down in test scores. How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade.
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: #Math and reading scores by grade:
The only difference now between the scores is that under 9th graders who attended Thomas High School it shows a Nan.
Scores by school spending
The numbers stay nearly identical since the 9th graders are nullified from the statistics.
Scores by school size
Overall passing percentage does not change.
Scores by school type
Scores by school type are not altered at all.
Summary:
Reviewing the analysis of the school district metrics after replacing the Thomas High School ninth-graders' scores with the value "Nan" yielded four notable changes to the district metrics:
1.	The average math exam score for the district was one-tenth of a percentage point lower.
2.	The percentage of students who passed the math exam was lowered by two-tenths of a percentage point.
3.	The percentage of students who passed the reading exam was lowered by three-tenths of a percentage point.
4.	The percentage of students who passed both the math and reading exams for the districts was lowered by one-tenth of a percentage point......
